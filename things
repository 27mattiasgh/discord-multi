things to do for a game (in general)


start with a slash command and bring up buttons
use buttons to interact
have other functions to call that handle the game state
edit the message based on game state (functions)
add a "end" button to exit out of the game loop
add a repeat button that resets the board for another game
include a currency-based system that deducts/increases coin amounts basied on outcome

(probably include all of this in one cog, if large enough consider speading out specific commands into diffrent files)

basicilly a big game loop that uses buttons to interact/end, and a slash command to start


first couple of games: 

tictactoe (maybe using the minimax algorithm)
blackjack (maybe implementing a algorithm of it's own)


chess, evenutally (using a dropdown with all possible moves) - use game id's and playing with bots (stockfish)
